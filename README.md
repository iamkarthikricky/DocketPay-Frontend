## Overview

1. The user signs in by providing valid credentials. If authenticated, they are redirected to the home page, where any fetched financial data will be displayed.

2. The dashboard features summary cards displaying total liabilities, receivables, and income based on the selected filters. Additionally, a dedicated chart provides a graphical analysis of financial flow.

3. When a financial record is added, it is updated accordingly based on its category.

Example: If a user wants to add a receivable from a friend, they enter the amount, due date, and borrower details before submitting the form. If the provided details are valid, an email is sent to the borrower with the recorded details. Additionally, both the lender and borrower will receive timely reminders regarding the financial record.

4. Only the user who added a financial record can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on it.
